# Text Statistics and Replacement App

## Overview
This React application provides a simple interface for users to input text, view real-time statistics, and perform string replacements. The app calculates the unique word count and character count (excluding spaces and punctuation) and allows users to replace specified strings within the text.

## Features
- **Real-time Text Input:** Users can type directly into a single textarea, and the app updates statistics as they type.
- **Unique Word Count:** Displays the count of unique words in the text, treating words case-insensitively.
- **Character Count:** Shows the number of characters excluding spaces and punctuation.
- **String Replacement:** Users can search for a string and replace it with another string. The replaced string will be highlighted in the textarea.
- **Responsive Design:** The UI is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Functionalities
1. **Input Area:** A large textarea for user input.
2. **Statistics Display:** Shows the unique word count and character count in real-time.
3. **String Replacement:**
   - Two input fields for the user to enter the search string and the replacement string.
   - A button to execute the replacement, updating the text in the textarea and highlighting the replaced string.
